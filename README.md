## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a junior frontend developer who is constantly learning and striving to improve my skills. Although I currently specialize in frontend development, my ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer, capable of developing and maintaining client-oriented applications and web pages.

My focus is on providing frontend support that simplifies the desired process, incorporating elegant styling and adhering to best practices to create a simple, readable, and efficient codebase.

Additionally, I am considering creating a repository for Spanish-speaking students, serving as a glossary to assist others in their learning journey. It is important to me to contribute in some way and be of service to others.
